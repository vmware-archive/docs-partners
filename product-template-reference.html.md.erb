title: Product Template Reference
---

This document define the separate pieces of a product template. For the purpose of explanation we will use the [1.6 example product tile](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/ops-manager-example/releases), a functional tile provided by the Ops Manager engineering team that deploys the NGINX web server.

## <a id='top-level'></a> Top Level Properties

The following is an example of the properties that appear at the top of a product template. Following this example are definitions of each property.

   ```
   ---
    name: example-product
    product_version: "1.6.0.0-alpha.3.3062"
    metadata_version: "1.5"
    label: 'Ops Manager: Example Product'
    description: An example product to demonstrate Ops Manager product-author features
    rank: 1
    stemcell_criteria:
      os: ubuntu-trusty
      requires_cpi: false
      version: "3062" # Bosh stemcell should match Ops Manager with same version
    releases:
    - name: example-release
      file: example-release-8.tgz
      version: "8"
    post_deploy_errands:
      - name: example-errand
    pre_delete_errands:
      - name: example-errand
    icon_image: R0lGODdhAgACAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAgACAAACAoRRADs=
  ```

Note: The icon_image is a single-pixel gif to keep the example readable. 

### name
String. Required.
The internal name of the product. You must keep the name of your product consistent for migrations to function properly. Changing the name indicates the installation of a completely different product.

### product_version
String. Required.
The version of the product. At present you can only import this version into Ops Manager once. If you intend to import the same product / version, you must delete the existing one from the /metadata folder and delete the installation files from Ops Manager's disk. The version number is important for [migrations](./migrations.html).

### metadata_version
String. Required.
The versioned structure of the product template (the file you are editing). Changing the version number can unlock new properties, and also break properties that changed from previous versions The metadata version does not always correlate to Ops Manager's version number and depends on what, or if, new metadata properties were introduced.

### label
String. Optional.
The label that appears in the product tile when it displays in the Ops Manager Dashboard.

### description
String. Optional.
A description of the product. This is not currently used but may be displayed in a future version of Ops Manager.

### rank
Integer. Required.
The order in which a product tile appears on the dashboard. The Ops Manager Director always appears at rank 100. For your product to appear to the right of Ops Manager Director (preferable) you must set this value to an integer less than 100. It is recommended that you set it to 1. Ops Manager will sort tiles alphabetically if all tiles have the same rank. This is a known weak point and will be improved in a future version of Ops Manager.

### stemcell_criteria
Hash. Required.
Refer to [the BOSH hub](https://bosh.io/) for a list of stemcells, including os and version. Notice that you do not specify which IaaS the Stemcell targets. This keeps your product template IaaS agnostic so that one product template can be deployed on any IaaS. At the time of this writing, none of the BOSH stemcells require a Cloud Provider Interface (CPI). This is expected to change in a future release of BOSH.

### releases
Array of Hashes. Required.
The list of releases contained in your product's releases directory. The version of the release must be exactly the same as the version contained in the release (BOSH releases are versioned and signed by BOSH).

### post\_deploy\_errands
Array of Hashes. Optional.
A list of errands that will run after a deploy succeeds. See [Lifecycle Errands](./lifecycle-errands.html)

### pre\_delete\_errands
Array of Hashes. Optional.
A list of errands that will run before a deployment is deleted.[Lifecycle Errands](./lifecycle-errands.html)

## <a id='form-properties'></a> Form Properties

The following is an example of the properties that appear in the form_types section of a product template. These forms appear on the left hand side, as links, after a user clicks on the tile itself. 

As shown in a later section, form properties reference property\_blueprints for the definition of the type of data (url, IP address, list, etc.) being saved. Form properties are themselves referenced in the manifest section of the job\_types section, which will also be explained later in this document. The eventual purpose of these properties is to hydrate a BOSH manifest, which Ops Manager generates on the user's behalf. 

Following this example are definitions of each property.

  ```
  form_types:
    - name: example-form

          selector_property_inputs:
            - reference: .properties.example_selector.pizza_option
              label: 'Pizza'
              property_inputs:

                  label: 'Add Pepperoni'
                - reference: .properties.example_selector.pizza_option.pineapple
                  label: 'Add Pineapple'
                - reference: .properties.example_selector.pizza_option.other_toppings
                  label: 'Other toppings'
            - reference: .properties.example_selector.filet_mignon_option
              label: 'Filet Mignon'
              property_inputs:
                - reference: .properties.example_selector.filet_mignon_option.rarity_dropdown
                  label: 'How rare?'    
  ```

### name
String. Required.
The internal name of the form.

### label
String. Required.
The label of the form as it appears as a link on the left hand side of each form.

### description
String. Optional.
The description of the form. Appears at the top of the form as a header.

### property_inputs
Array of Hashes. Required.
References to properties defined in the property_blueprints section of the product template.

## <a id='simple-vs-complex'></a> Simple vs. Complex Inputs (Selectors and Collections)

Most properties are simple values such as strings, integers, url addresses, or IP addresses. Others are complex, such as selectors or collections.

Selectors are a means of giving the user a choice of a set of inputs. Collections are a means of giving the user the ability to enter an array of values to create a hash. 

Selectors appear as follows:

<%= image_tag 'selector.png' %>

Collections appear as follows:

<%= image_tag 'collection.png' %>

## <a id='property-blueprints'></a> Property Blueprints

The following is an example of the property_blueprints that appear in a product template. These blueprints define anything that will eventually end up in the BOSH manifest generated by Ops Manager. References to these blueprints.

Note that one of these blueprints references a migrated value, which came from the Example Product v. 1.5 using [migrations](./migrations.html).

No property will be viewable in a form if unless **configurable** is set to **true**. Some properties are not viewable. Rather than giving the user the ability to enter a value, the value is generated by Ops Manager.

  ```
    property_blueprints:
      - name: example_string
        type: string
        configurable: true
        default: 'Hello world'
      - name: example_migrated_integer
        type: integer
        configurable: true
        default: 1
      - name: example_collection
        type: collection
        configurable: true
        optional: true
        property_blueprints:
          - name: album
            type: string
          - name: artist
            type: string
          - name: explicit
            type: boolean
      - name: example_selector
        type: selector
        configurable: true
        default: Pizza
        option_templates:
          - name: pizza_option
            select_value: Pizza
            named_manifests:
              - name: my_snippet
                manifest: |
                  pizza_toppings:
                    pepperoni: (( .properties.example_selector.pizza_option.pepperoni.value ))
                    pineapple: (( .properties.example_selector.pizza_option.pineapple.value ))
                    other: (( .properties.example_selector.pizza_option.other_toppings.value ))
            property_blueprints:
              - name: pepperoni
                type: boolean
                configurable: true
              - name: pineapple
                type: boolean
                configurable: true
              - name: other_toppings
                type: string
                configurable: true
                optional: true
          - name: filet_mignon_option
            select_value: Filet Mignon
            named_manifests:
              - name: my_snippet
                manifest: |
                  rarity: (( .properties.example_selector.filet_mignon_option.rarity_dropdown.value ))
            property_blueprints:
              - name: rarity_dropdown
                type: dropdown_select
                configurable: true
                default: rare
                options:
                  - name: rare
                    label: 'Rare'
                  - name: medium
                    label: 'Medium'
                  - name: well-done
                    label: 'Well done'
  ```

## <a id='configurable-props'></a> Configurable Properties

Many of these properties are strings, but can be used with validators in order to check that the user typed in the correct format for a url, IP, address, domain, etc.

### string
A string. 

### integer
An integer.

### boolean
A boolean. Viewed as a checkbox. 

### dropdown_select
A list of options. The user chooses one viewed as an HTML select box. 

### domain
A second, third, fourth, etc level domain.

### wildcard_domain
A domain with a wildcard in front of it. Example: `*.domain.com`

### text
A string. Appears as an HTML textarea.

### ldap_url
A url prefaced by `ldap://`.

### email
An email address.

### ip_ranges
A range of IP addresses, with dashes and commas allowed. Example: `1.1.1.1-1.1.1.4,2.2.2.1-2.2.2.4`

### port
An integer representing a network port.

### network_address
A single IP address or domain. Example: `1.1.1.1`

### network\_address\_list
A list of IP addresses or domains. Example: `1.1.1.1,example.com,2.2.2.2`

### Generated Properties (can also be configurable)

The following properties are configurable, but can also be generated by Ops manager if configurable is false, or the configurable key is omitted. The  exceptions are the uuid and salted credentials properties, which are never configurable.

### rsa\_cert\_credentials
An RSA certificate.

### rsa\_pkey\_credentials
An RSA private key.

### salted_credentials
Username and password created using a non-reversible hash algorithm.

### simple_credentials
Username and password.

### secret
A random string or password.

### uuid
A universal unique identifier.

### Complex Properties (Selectors and Collections)

The selector and collections inputs are referenced by their selector and collection property blueprints. These are more complicated than simple properties in that they contain manifest snippets, which are further referenced in other manifest snippets. We will learn about manifest snippets in the next section.

## <a id='job-types'></a> Job Types

The following is an example of the job_types section that appear in a product template. This section defines the jobs that end up in a BOSH Manifest. Those jobs are defined in your BOSH Release. Jobs require many different settings in order to function properly, and that is the crux of what Ops Manager does for you: it asks a user for values to those settings, and generates a manifest based on what was entered.

At the time of this writing, every job requires a property\_blueprint reference to vm\_credentials as appears below. This will be removed as a requirement in a future version of Ops Manager.

```
job_types:
  - name: web_server
    resource_label: Web Server
    templates:
      - name: web_server
        release: example-release
      - name: time_logger
        release: example-release
    release: example-release
    static_ip: 1
    dynamic_ip: 0
    max_in_flight: 1
    resource_definitions:
      - name: ram
        type: integer
        configurable: true
        default: 1024
      - name: ephemeral_disk
        type: integer
        configurable: true
        default: 2048
      - name: persistent_disk
        type: integer
        configurable: true
        default: 1024
        constraints:
          min: 1024
      - name: cpu
        type: integer
        configurable: true
        default: 1
    instance_definitions:
      - name: instances
        type: integer
        configurable: true
        default: 1
        constraints:
          max: 1
    property_blueprints:
      - name: vm_credentials
        type: salted_credentials
        default:
          identity: vcap
    manifest: |
      configured:
        string: (( .properties.example_string.value ))
        integer: (( .properties.example_migrated_integer.value ))
        
        record_collection: (( .properties.example_collection.value || [] ))
        selector: (( .properties.example_selector.selected_option.parsed_manifest(my_snippet) ))
      ops_manager_provided_accessors:
        name: (( name ))
        ram: (( ram ))
        ephemeral_disk: (( ephemeral_disk ))
        persistent_disk: (( persistent_disk ))
        instances: (( instances ))
        availability_zone: (( availability_zone ))
        first_ip: (( first_ip ))
        ips: (( ips ))
        ips_by_availability_zone: (( ips_by_availability_zone ))
        $ops_manager.ca_certificate: (( $ops_manager.ca_certificate ))
```

### name
String. Required.
The name of the job as it will be created in the Ops Manager generated BOSH manifest.

### resource_label
String. Required.
The label of the job as it will appear in the resources page of the tile.

### templates
Array of Hashes. Required.
This is a BOSH feature (creating jobs from different releases). See the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/) for more information.

### release
String. Required.
The name of the BOSH release contained in your product archive (.pivotal file).

### static_ip
Boolean. Required.
Sets whether the BOSH job should have a static or dynamic IP. Static IPs are set by the user, and reserved, while Dynamic IPs are set by BOSH. Both are, in effect, static, in that they should not change between deployments.

### dynamic_ip
Boolean. Required.
Set the opposite of static_ip. This will eventually be eliminated as a property as it is obviously redundant and unnecessary.

### max\_in\_flight
Integer. Required.
A BOSH setting that controls the number of instances of this job that BOSH will deploy in parallel.

### resource_definition
Array of Hashes. Required.
A set of resource settings for the job along with max and min constraints, defaults, and whether or not the user can configure (change) the setting. The resources that can be set are:

- ram
- ephemeral_disk
- persistent_disk
- cpu

### instance_definition
Hash. Required. 
The number of default instances for a job along with max, min, odd, and the ability to decrease sizing after deploy constraints.

### manifest
Text Snippet, prefaced by pipe symbol: **|**. Optional.
A BOSH manifest will be created by Ops Manager. The sections of that manifest will include each job, and the properties for that job. These properties come directly from the manifest snippet here, and use a syntax known as "double-parens" which consists of a variable name surrounded by two sets of parentheses.

The double-parens syntax will be evaluated when a user clicks the Apply Changes button in Ops Manager. A manifest is created and the double-parens variables are evaluated. The values, either entered by a user, or generated by Ops Manager, are dynamically inserted in place of the double-parens references.

### Selector Manifest Snippets

Selector snippets are evaluated twice. As you saw in the property_blueprint, the selector has a manifest snippet for both sets of inputs that the user might choose. Only one of these sets is evaluated and inserted into the job's manifest.

### Ops Manager Provided Snippets

There are double-parens accessors for a job's name, ram, ephemeral disk, persistent disk, instances, and availability zones in which jobs are placed. See the example of job types above for the example of these accessors.

In addition, Ops Manager supports accessors that are global to the entire installation rather than job specific. Currently, the only such accessor is `$ops_manager.ca_certificate`, which is the internal SSL CA certificate used to sign all SSL certificates generated by this Ops Manager instance, such as when the user clicks a **Generate Self-Signed RSA Certificat** link.
