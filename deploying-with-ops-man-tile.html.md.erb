title: Deploying Your Product as a Tile in Ops Manager
---
 
 <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: This topic is part of the [Creating a Pivotal Cloud Foundry® Product Tile](./creating.html) tutorial.  Before beginning this procedure, you should follow the procedure described in [Deploying a Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; Product Using BOSH](./deploying-with-bosh.html).</p>

This topic describes deploying a Cloud Foundry software product as a tile in [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) Ops Manager. Ops Manager uses BOSH to deploy software products to the cloud, and eases the process by providing the following:

- Automated error-checking
- Automated manifest generation
- Lifecycle management for upgrading a product when a new release is published

## <a id='deploy-ops-manager'></a>Step 1: Deploy Ops Manager

Download the latest Ops Manager from a shared AMI (Amazon Machine Image) on AWS, and launch it on the VPC you already created in [Deploying a Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; Product Using BOSH](./deploying-with-bosh.html).

1. Log in to [Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io), click the **Ops Manager** tile, and download the instructions for deploying Ops Manager on AWS. Open the PDF and record the AMI ID listed for your nearest region. You can ignore the rest of the instructions.

1. Log into AWS, navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard**, and click **Launch Instance**.

1. Click **Community AMIs** in the left column and search for the AMI ID you recorded from the Ops Manager instructions.

## <a id='configure-install'></a>Step 2: Configure and Install Ops Manager Director

1. In the AWS Console, navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.

1. Record the **Public IP** of your Ops Manager EC2 instance.

    <%= image_tag("deployed.png") %>

1. Open a browser tab and navigate to the Ops Manager IP address. Proceed through any privacy warnings.

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * <strong>[Use an Identity Provider](#idp)</strong>: If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * <strong>[Internal Authentication](#internal)</strong>: If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider ###

1. When redirected to the **Use an Identity Provider** page, you must choose one of the following:
    * Retrieve the metadata URL from your Identity Provider and copy it into the **Use an Identity Provider** area.
    * Create a passphrase. The passphrase you entered is a shared secret to encrypt Ops Manager data at rest.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

    <%= image_tag("meta-url.png") %>

1.  Your Identity Provider login page appears. Enter your username and password. Click **Login**.

### <a id='internal'></a>Internal Authentication ###

1.  When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must choose one of the following:
    * Enter a **Username** and **Admin password**.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable if forgotten.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

    <%= image_tag("om-login.png") %>

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password you created in the previous step.

## <a id='examine-example'></a>Step 4: Download and Examine the Example Product Tile

This step describes how you can build a product tile by examining its contents.

1. On your local workstation, download the latest release (not pre-release) version of the example product tile, called [Tutorial Tile](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/ops-manager-example/releases).

1. From the **Installation Dashboard**, click **Import a Product** and select the downloaded file. You should see the example product listed under **Available Products**.
<%= image_tag 'add-product.png' %>

1. Hover over the example product listing and click **Add**. The product tile should appear under **Installation Dashboard**.
<%= image_tag 'product-tile.png' %>

1. Change the example product download file extension from `.pivotal` to `.zip` and unzip the file.

1. To learn how Ops Manager product tiles are constructed, look through the example tile's configuration screens in Ops Manager and study the underlying files in the following directories:

    1. Content_migrations <strong>(optional)</strong>: Upgrading versions require migrations.

    1. Metadata <strong>(required)</strong>: This directory includes a product template which renders in Ops Manager, and instructions for how the correlated BOSH manifest is generated.

    1. Releases <strong>(optional)</strong>: This directory contains BOSH releases with the source code for a product. In this case, the release contains the NGINX webserver. 

## <a id='build-your-own'></a>Step 5: Build your own Product Tile

Create your own product tile by following the steps in these high level instructions and the linked reference documentation and other resources. Each step requires substantial work.

1. Build and create a BOSH release. The [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/) contains information about how to build a release. You can post questions to the BOSH community using the [CF-BOSH mailing list](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-bosh@lists.cloudfoundry.org) and [IRC Channel on Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bosh).

2. Create a Product Template by using the Example Product Tile as a model. Refer to the [Product Template Reference](./product-template-reference.html) for further clarification.

3. You may consider adding Lifecycle Errands to both your BOSH release and your Product Template. Refer to the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/) and the [Lifecycle Errands](./lifecycle-errands.html) topic for more information.

4. Create directory structure for your product folders, guided by the contents of the [Example Product Tile](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/ops-manager-example/releases), as described above. Archive the folders into a `.zip` file and import the file into a deployed Ops Manager. 

5. SSH into the Ops Manager VM and edit the product template at `/var/tempest/workspace/default/metadata` to directly make changes to your product tile. After making changes, refresh your browser to see the changes. You can click **Apply Changes** in the PCF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and view the resulting BOSH manifest in `/var/tempest/workspace/default/deployments`.

6. You must create a migration file to migrate values in subsequent releases of your product. Refer to the [Migrating Tile Versions](./migrations.html) topic more information about building migrations.
